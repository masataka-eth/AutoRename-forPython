# AutoRename-forPython

## Why
It is very difficult to change part names when generating "generative images"! I want to simplify this.

## How to Use
install Python

1. Run AutoRename.py
2. first, agree "I have made a backup of the subject folder"
3. Select namelist text
    - Prepare the file name to be renamed, separated by a new line.
    - extension is not included
    - Encoding must be "utf-8"
4. Select rename folder
    - The folder where all the files to be renamed are located directly under
    - Need to be in name sort order.
    - The same number of files as the namelist text must appear
5. Select extension
     - other-> Enter the extension you wish to rename. (no comma)
6. Finally, click the Go button

Enjoy!
